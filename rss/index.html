So relax and get ready to know about <em>The Great Eagles</em>.</p><p>While or after watching the eagles in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em>, you might have thought about them. Some might have concluded that they are some mysterious creatures or they are Tolkien&apos;s exemption or a scapegoat. But stop there, let me tell you &quot;<em>where do they come from?</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>what have they done in their time?</em>&quot;</p><p></p><h3 id="during-the-first-age">During the First Age-</h3><p></p><p>The Great Eagles, also known as the Eagles of <em>Manw&#xEB;</em>, were <em>Arda</em> beings who were said to have been &quot;devised&quot; by <em>Manw&#xEB; S&#xFA;limo</em>, the <em>Valar&apos;s</em> king. He was <em>Melkor&apos;s</em> brother, and he ruler of winds, air and the birds. He was the highest in authority but not the strongest. The Eagles were sent from <em>Valinor</em> to Middle-earth to keep an eye on the exiled <em>&#xD1;oldor</em>, as well as their arch-enemy, the wicked <em>Vala Morgoth</em>, and later,<em> Sauron.</em> </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tolkiennerds.online/content/images/2021/03/MANWE-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="All that you need to know about The Great Eagles" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1450"><figcaption>Manwe Sulimo by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/elbenherzart">ElbenherzArt</a></figcaption></figure><p>The Lord of the Eagles, <em>Thorondor</em> having more than 50 meters of wingspan was also sent to the Middle Earth. Thorondor, King of the Eagles, held his eyries atop Thangorodrim, the three mighty peaks Morgoth raised from the Iron Mountains above the gates of Angband, for a time. Thorondor assisted <em>Fingon</em> in rescuing <em>Maedhros</em> when they were living there. Thorondor&apos;s people later relocated their eyries to the <em>Crissaegrim</em>, which is situated near <em>Gondolin</em> and is part of the Echoriath. There they were friends of <em>Turgon</em>, and kept spies off the mountains.</p><p>After Morgoth&apos;s fight with Fingolfin, Thorondor wounded Morgoth in the face and took Fingolfin&apos;s body to the Echoriath, where Turgon buried him. During the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, the Great Eagles battled alongside the Valar, Elves, and Edain armies. Throndor also fought gloriously in the war and was heavily damaged, but no one knows his fate after that. Some fellow nerds think that he returned to Manwe after that and was healed.</p><p>It is also said that they hated Melkov as he tried to catch them to learn fly(which obviously didn&apos;t work)</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tolkiennerds.online/content/images/2021/03/THRANDUIL.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="All that you need to know about The Great Eagles" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1583"><figcaption>Thorondor by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/eleesar">Eleesar</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="during-the-second-age">During the Second Age-</h3><p></p><p>A pair of Eagles had an eyrie in the King&apos;s House in<em> Armenelos</em>, <em>Numenor</em>&apos;s capital, before the Kings became hostile to the <em>Valar </em>in the Second Age. The Eagles also kept an eye on <em>Mount Meneltarma&apos;s</em> peak, and when anyone ascended to the top, three Eagles would appear(people believed that they were sent by <em>Manwe</em> to protect the sacred mountain). The <em>Valar</em> sent storm clouds in the form of Great Eagles toward the end of <em>Numenor</em> to warn them of their folly and imminent doom.</p><h3 id="during-the-third-age">During the Third Age-</h3><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tolkiennerds.online/content/images/2021/03/armenelos.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="All that you need to know about The Great Eagles" loading="lazy" width="1998" height="896"><figcaption>Armenelos by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/skullbastard">skullbastard</a></figcaption></figure><p></p><p>Gwaihir and Landroval, Thorondor&apos;s descendants, lived in an eyrie to the east of the Misty Mountains in Wilderland(the goblin town that we see in The Hobbit) near Rivendell during the Third Age.</p><p>These Eagles aided Rivendell&apos;s Elves and Radagast in keeping an eye on the land and collecting information about the Orcs.</p><p>No eagles were mentioned by name in <em>The Hobbit</em>. In this storey, only the title &quot;Lord of the Eagles&quot; separated the eagle leader from the other eagles. Many readers believe that <em>Gwaihir</em> and <em>Landroval</em> were the ones who rescued <em>Thorin Oakenshield</em> and Company from a band of Wargs and goblins, flying them to the Anduin River, and then assisting in the Battle of the Five Armies near Lonely Mountain. However, <em>Gandalf</em> claims in The Return of the King that Gwaihir has borne him twice before, when the correct count is three if Gwaihir and <em>the Lord of the Eagles</em> are the same individual. Gwaihir rescued Gandalf the Grey from the top of Isengard, where he had been sent by Radagast, and from Zirak-Zigil before and during the War of the Ring. At the Battle of the Morannon at the Black Gate, the Eagles supported King Elessar&apos;s troops. The Eagles arrived just in time to help Kham&#xFB;l overthrow any Nazg&#xFB;l. After the One Ring was broken, Gwaihir and his people rescued Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee from Mount Doom in Mordor.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tolkiennerds.online/content/images/2021/03/EVSN.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="All that you need to know about The Great Eagles" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576"><figcaption>Eagle vs Nazgul on fellbeast by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/anatofinnstark">AnatoFinnstark</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="during-the-fourth-age">During the Fourth Age-</h3><p></p><p>Although some believe that they kept on living peacefully after <em>The War of the Ring</em> and gradually their size started to decrease but nothing has been said officialy by Tolkien.</p><h3 id="why-didnt-they-fly-frodo-to-mordor">Why didn&apos;t they fly Frodo to Mordor?</h3><p></p><p>This is the most classic question but lets end it today.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://tolkiennerds.online/content/images/2021/03/MEME.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="All that you need to know about The Great Eagles" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>Actually the quest of takin the ring to Mt Doom was to be a stealth task. If it were not, they would have collected huge armies and end up losing and gifting the ring to Sauron. Sauron also had an army of the fellbeasts so it wouldn&apos;t make any sense</p><p></p><h3 id="answer-me">Answer Me-</h3><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
